# RELLAX

Rellax is a buttery smooth, super lightweight (871bytes gzipped), vanilla javascript parallax library. Rellax limits the parallax feature to laptop/desktop screens since the effect is negligible on smaller screens.

3. Once feature is finished or bug fixed, use [jshint](http://jshint.com/) to lint code
4. Fix lint issues then use [Google Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) to minify
